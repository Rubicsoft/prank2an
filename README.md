Library used : [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)

## Cloning

Use `git lfs` to clone this repository, otherwise the LFS files won't be cloned.

**Additional Note** : `.a`, `.dll`, `.png`, `.jpg` are considered as LFS files.

## Compiling

**NOTE** : Windows only

`w64devkit` is required to build. You can download it [here](https://github.com/skeeto/w64devkit), and then install it.

Just type `make` in the command line and the repository will compile and generate the binary in the `Build/` directory.

**Additional Command** : `make run` will compile and run immediately, `make clean` will erase the compiled binary

### Does this program contain virus?

There is no virus in this program and it won't harm your computer anyway. It's just a rendering framework (using [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)). I made this program in Windows laptop and my laptop is still running good. In some cases, Windows Defender can sometimes consider this program as a virus and automatically delete it.

**TIPS** : Add this repository folder path to the Windows Defender exclusion settings if considered as a virus

I'm not a hackerman though, so I have no idea about it üóø
